## Week 00
1. [What is an Operating System (OS)?](https://www.techtarget.com/whatis/definition/operating-system-OS)
This link explains about what is operating system clearly and easy to understand. Various things about OS like its functions, architecture, types of interface, application management, device management, etc. is explained here.

2. [SaaS vs PaaS vs IaaS](https://www.bmc.com/blogs/saas-vs-paas-vs-iaas-whats-the-difference-and-how-to-choose/)
This link explains the differences between SaaS, PaaS, and IaaS as models of cloud computing. It also tells us many example services of those three. At first, I was confused about the difference between IaaS and PaaS, but after reading this link, I understand better.

## Week 01
1. [RegExr](https://regexr.com/)
RegExr is a regular expression tester with syntax highlighting. RegExr helps me when I was studying regex because it has user-friendly interface. For example, there is a syntax highlighting feature to mark substrings that matches the expression.

2. [Free Software vs Open Source Software](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/difference-between-free-software-and-open-source-software/)
This link taught me about the difference between free software and open source software. Its presentation method using tables made me understand much more about the difference between the two than before.

3. [Linux Commands Handbook](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/the-linux-commands-handbook/)
This link explains linux commands and its use clearly, easy to understand, and accompanied by various examples. In my opinion, this link is unique because most of links I visited before didn't provide an explanation that's good as this.
